# deepLearning
These depository was developed during my time as RCR Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow in Clinical Oncology. During this time I chose to develop my python skillset by developing a variety of machine learning scripts using freely available datasets such as the sklearn.datasets and MNIST.
These scripts include the use of supervised regression learning models such as linear regression, logistic regression , LASSO and ridge as well as deep neural networks (DNN) and convultional neural networks (CNN).
